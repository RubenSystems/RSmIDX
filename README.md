# RSmIDX
A Matrix index system for similarity search for any representation (sentence embeddings, image vectors, geopoints, etc). 

Similarity search implamented with locality sensitive hashing. Program implamented in C++ for efficiency reasons. Designed to be run in Python as it comes with python bindings. The LSH model currently requires several hash tables.
